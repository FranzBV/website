						<h1>Hey, I am Franz!</h1>
						<p>Seven years ago, I was playing a game on Roblox called daxter33’s paintball, when I accidentally shot a paintball through a wall and got a kill. This mere accident captivated my curiosity. How did I get that kill? As the sucker for information that I am, I craved for the answers, so I conducted mini-experiments to try to find them. I started by trying to shoot each gun through every wall in every map, then recording the data, but the testing conditions were too inadequate and inefficient since there were no practice servers. So, I did what any normal eleven-year-old would do; I tried recreating the game. Learning Java and Lua from YouTube videos, and utilizing some premade assets and scripts, I managed to recreate the different guns from the game. I then proceeded to replicate the maps of the game. After hundreds of tests, I analyzed the data gathered, and I noticed a trend where most guns can shoot through thin surfaces, which led me to another discovery — these guns can also shoot through floors. By the end, I concluded that due to the gun’s collision to other blocks was disabled, and the bullets would only appear on the tip of the weapon; the weapon, when piercing through, could shoot through thin walls. This mere accident ignited my passion and sparked an interest in programming.
